SVN uses a single centralized repository to serve as the communication hub for developers, and collaboration takes place by passing changesets between the developersâ€™ working copies and the central repository. This is different from Git's distributed collaboration model, which gives every developer their own copy of the repository, complete with its own local history and branch structure. Users typically need to share a series of commits rather than a single changeset. Instead of committing a changeset from a working copy to the central repository, Git lets you share entire branches between repositories.
